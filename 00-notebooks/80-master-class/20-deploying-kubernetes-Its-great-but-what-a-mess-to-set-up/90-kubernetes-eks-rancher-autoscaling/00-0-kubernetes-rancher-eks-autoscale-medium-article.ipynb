    "# Kubernetes & Rancher\n",
    "Kubernetes is a great tool that allows you to deploy and scale services in a cluster of servers. It’s great, but what a mess to set up! You have to write YAML files that have more lines than a zebra with a CLI that’s cool but not that visual. When you manage a complex infrastructure it’s nice to have visual feedback on what’s happening at the moment.\n",
    "And that’s why we have Rancher. An easy to set up dashboard that allows you to create and manage your Kubernetes clusters the way you want to. Visually or with the CLI.\n",
    "I won’t go into the details of installing Rancher on a machine. If you are here you might already have an instance of Rancher running. If not, just go on their website and follow the instructions. It’s super simple!\n",

    "## AWS EKS\n",
    "Now when you have a Kubernetes cluster running, you have to scale it to meet the demand. But, if you’re Uber or Deliveroo, you might need 100 servers running the cluster at 9 pm but at 2 am …. You won’t need these resources anymore. So what do you do? Do you struggle to change the size of the cluster every day by clicking on buttons or do you use a tool that does that on its own?\n",
    "And that’s why Amazon EKS is a good choice. Because this service allows you to create autoscaling policies that will grow the size of your infrastructure when you have a peak of traffic and then shrink it when you don’t need that much computing power anymore.\n",
    "It saves you time, money, the trouble of not having sized the cluster properly and it’s kind of a green approach since you’re not wasting power anymore.\n",
    "Thanks for the explanation man, but how do I mount this thing? — Thomas, the passionate CTO without much patience\n",
    "Well, let’s go then. Let’s set this beast up!"
